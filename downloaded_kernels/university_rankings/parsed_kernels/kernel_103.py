import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)

# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory

from subprocess import check_output
print((check_output(["ls", "../input"]).decode("utf8")))

# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.
