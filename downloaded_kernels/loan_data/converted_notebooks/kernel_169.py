# I tried to make this generic, so you can cut and paste whatever query you want, **after replacing the input files with the appropriate data source**.  For this example, I'm just working my way down the list of most popular SQLite kernels, and the next in line is the one identified below.

# **Source of query:**<br>
# [Total loans by state barplot](https://www.kaggle.com/bruessow/total-loans-by-state-histogram) by SvenBr√ºssow
