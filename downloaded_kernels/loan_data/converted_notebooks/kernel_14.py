# # Loan Size and ROI
# 
# ### Lets look at the loans themselves and how they preform for Lending Club
# 
# As I am analyzing this data the most recent rates are:   
#    - 30-Year Fixed 3.64%   
#    - 15-Year Fixed 2.76%
#    
# To look at the value of loans, lets consider the funded_amnt_inv variable which is described as 
# "The total amount committed by investors for that loan at that point in time". This represents the
# principle amount of the loan.
# 
# By understanding the loan amounts we will be able to see what types of loans do the best for LC and
# which have the highest rates of return.

#the average loan is a little less than $15,000.00
loan.funded_amnt_inv.describe()
#np.median(loan.funded_amnt)


# From this initial look at the loan size we can see that the majority of the loans are around
# $10,000 and that the loan amount distribution has right skew and fat tails. By segmenting the loan 
# amounts by subgroups, we can paint a better picture of LC lending practices.

termGroup = loan.groupby('term')
termGroup['funded_amnt_inv'].agg([np.count_nonzero, np.mean, np.std])


# We can see that there the majority of the loans(a little over 3/4ths) are 3 year loans and are for less 
# principal than the 5year loans as we would expect.

# ## Loans By Month and Year
# There are a few conclusions that can be reached looking at the last few charts:   
# 
# - We can se that the number of loans that LC is giving overtime is increasing as we would expect 
# with a company that is rapidly growing. I assume that such a rapid growth curve in the number of 
# loans will be accompanied by a decrease in the overall quality of the loans.
# 
# - There does appear to be some seasonal trends in the number of loans given within the year. 
# There peaks occuring in July and October which show small trending build ups between months. It is hard
# to say if these seasonal trends are the same by year, we would have to break the monthly loans down
# into years. This will be done as follows.

# So although these graphs aren't layed out in the best way, we can see that when plotted per year,
# the seasonality is essentially non-existent but because the volume in the past few years has been so much 
# higher the monthly averages are skewed by the last few years. The previously precieved seasonality was just
# a concequence of some higher volumes in 2014-2015. It might be the case that a sesonal pattern is 
# developing or could be exposed through standardizing the loan volumes.
