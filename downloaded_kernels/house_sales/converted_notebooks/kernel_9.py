# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
get_ipython().run_line_magic('matplotlib', 'inline')

from scipy.stats import skew

# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory

from subprocess import check_output
print(check_output(["ls", "../input"]).decode("utf8"))

# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.
df = pd.read_csv('../input/kc_house_data.csv')
df.info()

# sqft_living seems to be a very 'histogrammable' feature


# In[ ]:


fig,ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(12,8))
ax.hist(df['sqft_living'],bins=25,color='b',alpha=0.75)
plt.title('Sqft_living distribution');
# Note: The histogram is skewed


# In[ ]:


skew(df['sqft_living'])
# Note the skew, since the extremums of the distribution are very large, compared to the mean. 
# The max value of 13540 is ~ 12 standard deviations from the mean


# In[ ]:


# For a positive skew, usually a log transformation works
df['sqft_living'] = np.log1p(df['sqft_living'])
fig,ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(12,8))
ax.hist(df['sqft_living'],bins=25,color='b',alpha=0.75)
plt.title('Sqft_living distribution (Log)');


# In[ ]:


skew(df['sqft_living'])
# So we see that the skew can be much reduced by using a log transformation of the variable
